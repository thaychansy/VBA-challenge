<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  <body>
Instructions:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information: 
1. The ticker symbol
2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
4. The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Moderate solution:
Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Hard solution:
Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

NOTE:
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
